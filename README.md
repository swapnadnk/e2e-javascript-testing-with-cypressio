## Course Description

End-to-end testing is an incredibly powerful strategy. Essentially, it allows you to write programs that automatically interact with your web applications like a real user would. In this course, Shaun Wassell—a lifelong programmer and a Full-Stack Development Instructor—offers a comprehensive look at end-to-end testing using Cypress, which is one of the most popular and robust end-to-end testing tools available. Learn how to write and execute basic tests, and then move on to best practices for element selection, aliasing, and handling command results. Explore advanced Cypress features, such as hooks, environment variables, and test doubles, to create efficient and maintainable tests. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to perform real-world, end-to-end testing on any web application.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
